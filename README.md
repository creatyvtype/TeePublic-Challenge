# TEEPUBLIC CHALLENGE

To run:  
1. Clone repo locally  
2. Obtain .env file from author and place in main directory  
3. Install gems with `bundle install`  
4. Run server with `rails s` (No migrations should be required)  

*Note*
The API did not allow background removal without paying for the service, so that part was not done.  
Also, I way overthought it on the Ajaxified branch where I tried to make some options happen. Otherwise, this challenge was fairly simple.
